## AWS SQS API DOCS for python

I found that the AWS SQS (Amazon Web Service Simple Queuing Service) python Boto3 API is difficult to understand and navigate.
It is hard for any beginner to get a overall grasp of what the methods are. 

So I created a overall architecture view of the API's.

For better view with click and navigate feature pls use this google drawing page [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1kKezJMZtO3wDhj9ColpIr9ONYByeGVBL0A_QVK1pSzU/edit?usp=sharing).
