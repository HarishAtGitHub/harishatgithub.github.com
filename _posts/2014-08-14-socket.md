## What is a socket ?

Socket is defined as the endpoint of communication between two processes. These two entities can be two processes
running in the same system or in systems connected by a network.

To understand better about sockets, let us see how a webserver and client communicates. 
How do you think they communicate internally ? It is like a typical PostBox service. When we want to
post a letter to someone we write it and then post it in the post box. Then the postman comes and takes it
from the post office and delivers it to the person to whom the letter is addressed to.
